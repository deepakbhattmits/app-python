# A tuple is a built-in data structure in Python that is an ordered collection of objects. Unlike lists, tuples come with limited functionality.

# The primary differing characteristic between lists and tuples is mutability. Lists are mutable, whereas tuples are immutable. 
# this is the use case of person name, age, here we can omit flower braces
