# Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
# * Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.
# Set do not allow duplicate values. 
list =['A','B','C','A','C']
print(set(list))

# we can use curly braces like a dictionary, however we don't enter key value pairs but values this automatically understood by python this is a set variable
list1 ={'ABC','ABCD','CDE','ABC'}
print(list1)
